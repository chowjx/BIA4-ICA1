# Chest X-Ray Image Segmentation - Kaggle Dataset Utilization

## Overview
This guide outlines the steps to use the Kaggle dataset "Chest X-Ray Masks and Labels" for training an image segmentation model.

## Prerequisites
- **Kaggle Account**
- **Kaggle API Key** (`kaggle.json`)

## Steps

### Environment Setup and Dataset Download
- **Install Necessary Packages**: Ensure all required libraries are installed.
- **Kaggle API Access**: Upload your `kaggle.json` file to access Kaggle datasets.
- **Dataset Download**: Obtain the Chest X-Ray dataset from Kaggle.
- **Unzip Dataset**: Extract the dataset for further use.

### Function Definitions
- **Define key functions** essential for model training and evaluation.

### Data Loading
- **Load and preprocess the data** to make it ready for training.

### Model Training
- **Conduct training** using the processed dataset.
- **Save the model** post-training.

### Model Download
- **Retrieve the trained model** from its storage location.

### Testing with External Dataset
- **Reload the trained model**.
- **Perform tests** on an external dataset.
- **Note**: Adapt file paths to suit your specific environment.

## Additional Notes
- The initial setup is tailored for **Google Colab**. Modify as needed for other environments.
- Regularly **verify paths and environment configurations** for compatibility with your setup.
