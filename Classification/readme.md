Since all the codes and datasets (Ineternal and External) for classification are public and available at kaggle,
you can run this train and test model in kaggle through this link by GPU! 
https://www.kaggle.com/code/selix075/classification-training-testing/edit

Though this kaggle link, you do these things:
# 1. Load packages and set hyperparameters
# 2. define important functions for training and testing
# 3. Load the data for training
# 4. Training (5-fold cross validation> If you want to save more time, you can intercept codes here once you obtain the 0-fold model.)
# 5. Download the saved models from training
# 6. input the external testing dataset
# 7. Reload the model and test the external dataset (Remember to change the paths!)
# 8. Preparation for GUI
