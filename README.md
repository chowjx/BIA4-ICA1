This software is based on python3.7 or later, aiming to help clinical researchers to accurately segment the thoracic region and classify tuberculosis from patientsâ€™ chest x-ray images. For 
image processing, these algorithms will occupy a large memory. Therefore, please use it properly based on your operating device. 
Before using this software, ensure that you have installed python packages PyQt5 5.15.10, Tensorflow 2.15.0, opencv-python 4.8.1.78, numpy 1.26.2 in your python environment. This software zip file contains three python script files, three .h5 model files, as well as three test cases.

The input image should be a chest x-ray image in .png, .jpg, .jpeg format. We support the image segmentation and classification of a single x-ray image.

What you could run is the file, GUImain_final.py.

GUImain.py will produce the graphical user interface of the software Tuberculosis Detector. 

You can follow the instructions in the documentation or watch the video Tuberculosis_Detector_user_guide.mp4.
(https://github.com/chowjx/BIA4-ICA1/blob/main/Tuberculosis_Detector_user_guide.mp4) to run the software on your server.
